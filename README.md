# The Portfolio

Hey there, this portfolio is built purely using React JS and CSS. The portfolio is *built responsive* (adapting to screens), but **for a better experience, viewing from a Laptop/Computer (Landscape mode) is suggested**.

# Contact page

The contact page features different ways to connect with me.

- There also is a way that you can directly send me a message. Whatever the content you enter in there, will be sent as an email to me.

- The message functionality used in the "Contact" page is established leveraging <a href=https://formspree.io>https://formspree.io</a>

    Note : For the mail option to work properly, your system should have a default app for Email services.

<h1 id="design-choices">Design choices</h1>

The basic idea of design of the site is quite simple. I wanted it to simple and minimalistic. So I have decided to use only 2 colors throughout. The color choice happened to be so straight forward with an idea of contrasting colors. That's why you'll predominantly see either black or white, or shades from that palette. Other colors are used sparingly, if at all.

For the design of the landing page, I wanted it to carry my persona. Since i spend a lot of time listening to music, what better describes a melophile other than Spotify (atleast in India / atleast me) ?

So the UI is heavily for the home page is heavily inspired from **Spotify**. But keeping the color choice in mind, changes were made accordingly.

To carry my personality, the **rotating casette** is added in the projects page.

The waving hand emoji in the contact page is used as a hook to make the users feel better while leaving the page. Watching a hand wave at them (in color, after 5 pages long monochrome), people may just feel good  and happy.

The choice of fonts throughout the website is the toughest part, when asked. I spent a lot of time exploring different fonts and found a few good styles. 

- Fonts used :
    - <a href="https://www.dafont.com/valorant.font">Valorant</a>
    - <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit">Outfit</a>
    - <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Dela+Gothic+One">Dela Gothic One</a>
    - <a href="https://www.dafont.com/inversionz.font">Inversionz</a>
    - <a href="https://www.dafont.com/dimitri.font">Dimitri</a>
    - <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bungee+Hairline">Bungee Hairline</a>

- Icons used are from:
    - <a href="https://fonts.google.com/icons">Google icons</a>
    - <a href="https://fontawesome.com/icons">Font awesome</a> 
<br><br>


# Website in portrait mode

As aforementioned, the website is made responsive. So for the displays in portrait mode, I wanted to suggest users to view the site in landscape mode. So when opened in a portrait mode display, the landing page will not be displayed on load. Instead you will see this.

Clicking on **No thanks** will take you to the home page of the website.
The rest has almost no changes unless the casette won't be displayed in portrait mode. <br><br>
